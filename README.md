Github is a website, you do not need to download it to your desktop. All you need to do is go to the website, create an account, and create a repository in order to get started.
Git is a software that comes preinstalled on your computer if you use Mac or Linux, but you will need to download it off of its official website if you are on windows. Git is used to save files and commit changes to files, which you can send over to github very easily.
After sending your code to Github, other people can see the final product and all changes to said code, while also being able to download it themselves.
This makes using Github a very streamlined and important product in order for people to work on projects with one another, or for people to see what other projects people have worked on.
